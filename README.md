This is the notelist Web Application Project User Interface

The project is following a mobile first approach.
For developing this small project I have used a the following frontend development workflow and tools.

-Node and NPM in order to download and manage project packages needed for development but also in a production environement.
-Git and GitHub in order to keep track all the changes during the project development phase.
-Gulp in order to automate most of the frontend workflow.
-PostCss - for the most CSS processing tasks. I have used mixins, variables and import packages in order to manage the website responsivenes and CSS styles.
Also in regards to writing CSS for this project a CSS Arhitecture was used. B.E.M filosophy was also applied to write the css styles for this project.
